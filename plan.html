<h2>Chilly Group</h2>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The main goal of redesigning this site is to sell event/concert tickets and get people in the seats. Secondary goals include memberships, engaging the public, creating a platform for musicians abroad to connect with TCMC, generate volunteers, and to raise awareness of the TCMC in the community.


<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the website depends largely on whether it meets the goals set out by the client, that is, does the website:</p>
<ul><li>Generate Ticket Sales</li>
<li>Encourage Membership</li>
<li>Engage Members</li>
<li>Generate Volunteers</li>
<li>Raise TCMC Profile in the Community</li>
</ul>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The demographic of our target audience are aged between 17 - 34. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics this age group spends the most time online compared to any other age bracket. We will design with this audience in mind by having a website that is accessible on modern devices (phone, tablet) that uses big buttons as links for the touch screen enviroment. More ways we are designing with this user in mind is by adding links to social media.</p>
