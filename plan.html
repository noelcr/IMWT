<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The goals of redesigning this site is to increase the amount of event/concert tickets sold and incease the amount of new memberships.


<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the website can be determined by measuring to see if there has been:</p>
<ul><li>An increase of ticket Sales</li>
<li>An increase of new memberships</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
    
The target audience will consist of both males and females aged between 16-25. This is due to new musicians who are beginning to perform/get involved with the music community will consist heavily of this younger demographic. An example of this new audience could be a young person just leaving school who is looking for the opportunity to continue their music career. According to Jeff Nielsen, the current owner of the website, the current users/demographic consist of older people aged over 40. <br><br>

We will design with this audience in mind by having a website that is accessible on modern devices (phone, tablet) that uses big buttons as links for the touch screen enviroment. More ways we are designing with this user in mind is by adding links to social media.</p>
