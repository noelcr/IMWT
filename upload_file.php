/*
PHP File uploading example for CP2010
Lindsay Ward, 2014 (from various iterations over the years)

Note: with image resizing using WideImage library (requires GD): http://wideimage.sourceforge.net/

This script receives input from a form - with enctype="multipart/form-data" - 
and a form element: <input type="file" name="imagefile" id="imagefile" />  

As usual, this is a basic demonstration that you can customise to suit your design needs.
